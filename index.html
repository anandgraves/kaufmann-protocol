                      <h2>Aloe Vera</h2>
                      <p>The use of Aloe Vera goes back at least 6,000 years. Originally from south eastern Africa, it spread to the Mediterranean and then across the globe.  Its uses are varied, and appreciated by innumerable historical figures. In addition to its health benefits, Aloe Vera was also used as papyrus, an embalming fluid and as a hanging plant over doors to ward off evil spirits.</p>

                      <h2>Alpha Lipoic Acid</h2>
                      <p>Alpha Lipoic acid exists naturally in human cells, mostly in the mitochondria, where very small quantities are produced endogenously from octanoic acid. Most of our Alpha LA comes from dietary sources. The substance is produced by both plants and animals, with the majority coming from red meat, liver, heart and kidneys. In the plant world, spinach, broccoli and tomatoes yield the most, although there is significantly less than in the animal products.</p>
                      
                      <p>Because of its molecular arrangement, there are two possible isomers, R-Lipoic Acid and S-Lipoid Acid. In nature, only the R is active. When produced synthetically, however, both isomers are created, but only the R is beneficial.</p>
                      
                      <p>The agent was first identified in the1930’s in potatoes as a necessary growth factor for specific bacteria; thus it was named the potato growth factor. In 1951, it was isolated from cow liver. It wasn’t until the 1980s that its antioxidant properties were discovered. It can be used for treating toxicities from poison mushrooms and radiation contamination.</p>

                      <h2>Apigenin</h2>
                      <p>Apigenin is found in many herbs, including parsley, celery, onions, oregano and thyme. The most consumed source however, is Chamomile tea.</p>
          
                      <p>Chamomile was first appreciated by the Egyptians, who dedicated it to the sun god, Rah. Hieroglyphic records show that chamomile was used cosmetically by Egyptian noblewomen, who applied crushed petals to their skin. The oil of Chamomile was additionally utilized in the process of mummification. (This may be the very first time it was used in the quest for immortality…although perhaps it was a little too late).</p>
          
                      <p>More recently, Apigenin was isolated from tea in 1914. Luckily it is also found in red wine and beer.</p>
